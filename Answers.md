1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.
    Server side routing is when we visit a new url, the server sends us everything we need just for that one specific url(Html, css, etc..). With client side routing the server sends us everything and we can control the view of the page using react router for a better user experience. Our users wont have to reload a whole new page for simple tasks.

    Fetch is becoming the standard way to fetch data due to it being native to Javascript now.
